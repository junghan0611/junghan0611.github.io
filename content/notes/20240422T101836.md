## 데이브 토마스 할아버지의 책 {#데이브-토마스-할아버지의-책}

Foreword A Vain Attempt at a Justification, Take Two Acknowledgments

1.  Take the Red Pill Programming Should Be About Transforming Data Installing Elixir Running Elixir Suggestions for Reading the Book Exercises Think Different(ly) Part I. Conventional Programming
    1.  Pattern Matching Assignment: I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means. More Complex Matches Ignoring a Value with _ (Underscore) Variables Bind Once (per Match) Another Way of Looking at the Equals Sign
    2.  Immutability You Already Have (Some) Immutable Data Immutable Data Is Known Data Performance Implications of Immutability Coding with Immutable Data
    3.  Elixir Basics Built-in Types Value Types System Types Collection Types Maps Binaries Dates and Times Names, Source Files, Conventions, Operators, and So On Variable Scope End of the Basics
    4.  Anonymous Functions Functions and Pattern Matching One Function, Multiple Bodies Functions Can Return Functions Passing Functions as Arguments Functions Are the Core
    5.  Modules and Named Functions Compiling a Module The Function’s Body Is a Block Function Calls and Pattern Matching Guard Clauses Default Parameters Private Functions The Amazing Pipe Operator: |&gt; Modules Module Attributes Module Names: Elixir, Erlang, and Atoms Calling a Function in an Erlang Library Finding Libraries
    6.  Lists and Recursion Heads and Tails Using Head and Tail to Process a List Using Head and Tail to Build a List Creating a Map Function Reducing a List to a Single Value More Complex List Patterns The List Module in Action Get Friendly with Lists
    7.  Maps, Keyword Lists, Sets, and Structs How to Choose Between Maps, Structs, and Keyword Lists Keyword Lists Maps Pattern Matching and Updating Maps Updating a Map Structs Nested Dictionary Structures Sets With Great Power Comes Great Temptation
    8.  An Aside—What Are Types?
    9.  Processing Collections—Enum and Stream Enum—Processing Collections Streams—Lazy Enumerables The Collectable Protocol Comprehensions Moving Past Divinity
    10. Strings and Binaries String Literals The Name “strings” Single-Quoted Strings—Lists of Character Codes Binaries Double-Quoted Strings Are Binaries Binaries and Pattern Matching Familiar Yet Strange
    11. Control Flow if and unless cond case Raising Exceptions Designing with Exceptions Doing More with Less
    12. Organizing a Project The Project: Fetch Issues from GitHub Step 1: Use Mix to Create Our New Project Transformation: Parse the Command Line Write Some Basic Tests Refactor: Big Function Alert Transformation: Fetch from GitHub Step 2: Use Libraries Transformation: Convert Response Transformation: Sort Data Transformation: Take First n Items Transformation: Format the Table Step 3: Make a Command-Line Executable Step 4: Add Some Logging Step 5: Create Project Documentation Coding by Transforming Data
    13. Tooling Debugging with IEx Testing Code Dependencies Server Monitoring Source-Code Formatting Inevitably, There’s More Part II. Concurrent Programming

        1.  Working with Multiple Processes A Simple Process Process Overhead When Processes Die Parallel Map—The “Hello, World” of Erlang A Fibonacci Server Agents—A Teaser Thinking in Processes
        2.  Nodes—The Key to Distributing Services Naming Nodes Naming Your Processes Input, Output, PIDs, and Nodes Nodes Are the Basis of Distribution
        3.  OTP: Servers Some OTP Definitions An OTP Server GenServer Callbacks Naming a Process Tidying Up the Interface Making Our Server into a Component
        4.  OTP: Supervisors Supervisors and Workers Worker Restart Options Supervisors Are the Heart of Reliability
        5.  A More Complex Example Introduction to Duper The Duper Application But Does It Work? Planning Your Elixir Application Next Up
        6.  OTP: Applications This Is Not Your Father’s Application The Application Specification File Turning Our Sequence Program into an OTP Application Supervision Is the Basis of Reliability Releasing Your Code Distillery—The Elixir Release Manager OTP Is Big—Unbelievably Big
        7.  Tasks and Agents Tasks Agents A Bigger Example Agents and Tasks, or GenServer?

        Part III. More Advanced Elixir

        1.  Macros and Code Evaluation Implementing an if Statement Macros Inject Code Using the Representation as Code Using Bindings to Inject Values Macros Are Hygienic Other Ways to Run Code Fragments Macros and Operators Digging Deeper Digging Ridiculously Deep
        2.  Linking Modules: Behaviours and use Behaviours use and using Putting It Together—Tracing Method Calls Use use
        3.  Protocols—Polymorphic Functions Defining a Protocol Implementing a Protocol The Available Types Protocols and Structs Built-in Protocols Protocols Are Polymorphism
        4.  More Cool Stuff Writing Your Own Sigils Multi-app Umbrella Projects But Wait! There’s More!

        A1. Exceptions: raise and try, catch and throw Raising an Exception catch, exit, and throw Defining Your Own Exceptions Now Ignore This Appendix A2. Type Specifications and Type Checking When Specifications Are Used Specifying a Type Defining New Types Specs for Functions and Callbacks Using Dialyzer Bibliography
